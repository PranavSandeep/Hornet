Hello~

So I decided to learn how to integrate c++ and python together. And what better way to start than create a math library with GPU paralell computing? /s

So this is still very barebones and more functions will be added as it goes(hopefully)

So, a brief tutorial on how to use it:


## Dot function (hornet.dot) ##

This function is the usual dot product of 2 vectors. Give it two vectors, it gives you their dot product. Standard stuff. (Oh, did I mention it uses Cuda? :3)

## Add vectors function(hornet.add_vectors) ##

This function adds 2 vectors... That's it.

## Magnitude (hornet.magnitude) ##

Returns the length of the vector
